# SQL Learning Journey

Hi and welcome ! This space documents my progression in learning SQL from basic concepts to more advanced queries. Each section represents a key concept in SQL, complete with exercises and some explanations

I Started learning SQL on December 30th. My current focus is to do a bunch of different exercices, on different databases after each keyword learned so that I can consolidate my knowledge. Trying to make solid layers on the pyramid of knowledge !

## Learning Structure

It is organized into progressive levels of SQL concepts (adding more when I get to them) :

### 1. Basic Queries
- Understanding SELECT statements
- Working with WHERE clauses
- Learning about ORDER BY and data filtering

### 2. Joins
- Exploring INNER JOINs
- Understanding LEFT and RIGHT JOINs
- Mastering multiple table operations

### 3. Aggregations
- Using COUNT, SUM, AVG functions
- Working with GROUP BY
- Understanding HAVING clauses

## Resources
- [List of learning resources will be added here]
- I will do 5 to 10 exercices on each database for each known keyword. After what I will continue to the next keyword. I might do more exercices if I don't grasp the concept yet, but I aim to do at least 15 to 20 exercices for each keyword (I have 3 databases for now).
- I will put one exercice that I found the most significant in the lesson as an exemple for each keyword in the designed desk

## Goal
My goal is to master fundamental SQL queries as well as building a strong foundation.
I know that exercices help a lot to remember, so I will practice right after I learn a new keyword.

I cannot fail. This profession is my dream job. I will learn as much as necessary to be valuable.
