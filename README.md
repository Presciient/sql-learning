# SQL Learning Journey

Hi and welcome ! This space documents my progression in learning SQL from basic concepts to more advanced queries. Each section represents a key concept in SQL, complete with exercises and some explanations

## Learning Structure

It is organized into progressive levels of SQL concepts :

### 1. Basic Queries
- Understanding SELECT statements
- Working with WHERE clauses
- Learning about ORDER BY and basic data filtering

### 2. Joins
- Exploring INNER JOINs
- Understanding LEFT and RIGHT JOINs
- Mastering multiple table operations

### 3. Aggregations
- Using COUNT, SUM, AVG functions
- Working with GROUP BY
- Understanding HAVING clauses

## Resources
- [List of learning resources will be added here]

## Data bases
- I will work with 4 differents Data bases that I will put in ressources (yet to be defined) and do 5 to 10 exercices on each known keyword for each data base
- I will put one exercice as an exemple for each keyword in the designed desk

## Goal
My goal is to master fundamental SQL queries as well as building a strong foundation.
I know that exercices help a lot to remember, so I will practice right after I learn a new keyword
This is the plan for now, I'll see how it goes :D
