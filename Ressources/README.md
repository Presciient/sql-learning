# Resources

This is the Resources folder of my SQL learning journey project. It contains all the resources I use throughout my SQL learning path

## Folder Structure

```
Resources/
├── practice_databases/ 
│   └── Chinook.md            # Example databases
│   └── Northwind.md 
│   └── DVDRental.md          # Online courses and tutorials

└── README.md      
```

## Component Description

### Learning Platforms

The `learning_platforms` directory contains an `online_courses.md` file that lists all the online courses I've been using. Each course is documented with:

- A link to the resource
- A description of the content
- My personal learning notes

### Practice Databases

The `practice_databases` directory contains the databases I use for practice. Each database includes:

- The database schema (schema.sql)
- Sample data (data.sql)


## Evolution of the Directory

This structure is designed to be simple and scalable. It will be enriched with new resources and databases as I progress in my learning journey :D


## Contribution

Suggestions for new resources or improvements to the structure are welcome ! Thanks in advance
