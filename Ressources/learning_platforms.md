## I will mainly use these to learn :

## SQL.SH (https://sql.sh/)

It is a French website with a lot of free SQL courses, it seems very detailed. So detailed that I feel that if I finish all the courses, I will know everything about SQL
I used W3Schools first but this one looks more complete
I don't think I will even need more to just learn but there is another one that I like a lot


## SQL Murder Mystery (https://mystery.knightlab.com/)

It's a fun game that I can't wait to dive into. You incarnate a detective that should resolve a mystery using SQL
I really like these kind of educative games, so I will do that as well and look for others
If I find other sites or useful learning material, I will mention them here
