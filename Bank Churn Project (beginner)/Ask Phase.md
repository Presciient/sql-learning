# The Ask Phase

This is the phase where I aim to understand the problem. 
It might not be relevant in this project, but in a work environment, this is the phase where I ask questions to myself and to the stakeholders with the intention of understanding what the issue is, what stakeholders expect from me and overall,
to align my goals to the stakeholders'.

## Questions to Stakeholders

- **What is the problem you want to solve ?**
- **What are you expecting from the analysis ? What do you look forward to ?**
- **What specific outcomes or decisions do you hope to inform with this analysis ?**
- **How would you define the success of this analysis/project ?**
- **Are there any constraints (time, budget, resources) that I should be aware of ?**

## Questions to Myself

- **What do the stakeholders state the problem is ?**
- **How can I solve it ?**
- **What is the broader context or background of this problem ?**
- **How will I measure the success of my analysis beyond stakeholder satisfaction ?**

Unfortunately, this is just a little project, and I don't have stakeholders. So it will mostly be explorative analysis.   
But these are the questions I could ask in the Ask phase.
