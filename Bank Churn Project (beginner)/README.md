First project ! 


I finaly decided to try to do a project ! I felt like I learned enough to at least try and see how I could handle a (very ðŸ˜…) beginner project

As I learned on the Google Analytics Certificate, I will employ the APPASA method (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act) for all my projects. I find it to have a good structure, so I might use it for every project until I find something even more robust !


In this README, I will resume every steps of the APPASA method so I can have a summury/overview of the project here. 
Alongside with the README, there will be 6 other files for the 6 steps of the method.

# A summury ! What was this project about ?

It's basically just an analysis I did over a dataset I found on Maven. The dataset is about a bank's customer churn. Here is what the clean CSV looks like :

My goal was to try to do a project using the 3 tools I know : SQL, Excel and Power BI. I found this dataset quite relevent, so I tried with it.



# And now, the APPASA method !

I will summarise the tasks I did (or would've done if it's not applicable on this project) for each step of the APPASA method.

You can check each file to have all the details (code, thinking process, manipulations, etc...). 

I wont put absolutely everything I did, because I respect your time. I will put what I think is the most interesting.
