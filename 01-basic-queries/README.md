#### In this section, I will learn everything that falls into "basic queries" appellation. I will put an exemple of exercice for each keyword in the exercice file as well as my thoughts/struggles/successes on the keyword/exercice.

#### Trying to be exhaustive, in this section I aim to learn about : 

-  SELECT
-  INSERT INTO
-  UPDATE
-  DELETE
-  DISTINCT 
-  WHERE 
-  AND & OR 
-  IN 
-  BETWEEN 
-  LIKE 
-  IS NULL / IS NOT NULL 
-  ORDER BY 
-  LIMIT 

#### These are basic keywords that I should learn before going to the next folder. I will learn the concepts, do a bunch of exercices for each of them and when I feel confident enough I will come back here and mark the ones that I master. I already know most of them since it has already been a week of learning, but I rather consolidate the knowledge and keep this structure for the next, harder concepts
