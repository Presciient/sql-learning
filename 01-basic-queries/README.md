#### In this section I will learn the fundamentals. I will put an exemple of exercice for each keyword in the exercice file as well as my thoughts/struggles/successes on the keyword/exercice.

#### Trying to be exhaustive, in this section I aim to learn about : 

- SQL SELECT  
- SQL DISTINCT 
- SQL WHERE 
- SQL AND & OR 
- SQL BETWEEN 
- SQL IN 
- SQL LIKE et SQL Wildcards 
- SQL IS NULL / IS NOT NULL 
- SQL ORDER BY 
- SQL AVG() 
- SQL COUNT() 
- SQL MAX() 
- SQL MIN() 
- SQL SUM() 
- SQL GROUP BY 

#### These are basic keywords that I should learn before going to the next folder. I will learn the concepts and do a bunch of exercices to master them. I already know most of them since it has already been a week of learning, but I rather consolidate the knowledge and keep this structure for the next, harder concepts
