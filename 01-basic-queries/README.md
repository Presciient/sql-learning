Started learning SQL on December 30th. I've been learning on W3schools. The tutoral is decent but the exercices are not really challenging. It's just multiple choices answers and not actual code writting
so I decided to add other sources for practice. I will mostly use W3schools to learn concepts and then find exercices on the internet to practice. I feel really motivated so far !

My current focus is to do a bunch of different exercices on different databases to consolidate the few basic things I already learned. We're trying to make a solid first layer for the pyramid of knowledge !

I might learn during the first half of the day and practice what I learned during the second one
